# ESP32-code
Here is the code I'm running on my ESP32 as of April 2022

The setup is using examples found on the excellent SensESP pages here - https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP 

I now have engine temperature, exhaust temp, engine RPM, engine room environmental and engine runtime using the ESP uptime.

I'm currently testing (estimated) fuel consumption which is using the engine RPM and fuel burn info from the Volvo Penta documents. 

I plan to add a bilge alarm to detect any water ingress.

Videos of my setup can be found on our YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/c/BoatingwiththeBaileys

Hope this is helpful and my thanks to all the talented people writing the code and continuing to develop these projects!
